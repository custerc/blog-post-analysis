Analyzing Google Analytics data in ways GA doesn't allow

At present, a Jupyter Notebook with code that will quickly turn a specific GA report's output into a sorted CSV for percent-change analysis of landing page metrics: https://github.com/custerc/blog-post-analysis/blob/master/Blog%20Landing%20Page%20Change%20Comparison.ipynb

Additional prewritten code sections and proper comments to be added later.
